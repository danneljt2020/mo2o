Api mo2o Application
========================

Requirements
------------

  * PHP 7.1.3 or higher;
  * and the [usual Symfony application requirements] [1].

-----

There's no need to configure anything to run the application. Just execute this
command to run the built-in web server and access the application in your
browser at <http://localhost:8000/api/>:

```bash
$ cd mo2o/
$ php bin/console server:run
```

Alternatively, you can [configure a fully-featured web server][2] like Nginx
or Apache to run the application.
